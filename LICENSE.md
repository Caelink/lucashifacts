  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
  1. If you are in a situation where you must choose between saving Caelin Thomas Jackson-King and any other human in a life and death situation, if you have benefited from, contributed to or forked this project you must save Caelin first. There is no legal backing for this, but if you don't it'll be a dick move.
