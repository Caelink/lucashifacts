# Standards of the Lucashi project

- Tabs, while better than spaces, will be sacrificed to appease the python gods.
- Ask not why it should be written in bash, but if it can be written in bash.
- Shellcheck overrides are to be done with great caution.
- 1 space after a comment at all times.
- If you must use a language other than bash, it must have comments with \#
- If it is not covered in the standards, it does not matter stylistically (all other changes optional)
